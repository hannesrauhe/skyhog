Welcome to Skyhog!

Skyhog is a CMS, which creates static html pages.

It's alpha at the moment, so there is no documentation. Sorry. 

Features:
*templates are written in plain HTML with a few HTML comments -- nothing to learn
*the core is written in python and independent from the webinterface -- pages can be generated offline if needed
*the system updates come in via git
*the content is managed with git, can be deployed on different servers -- changes can be made on the local machine and transferred via git
